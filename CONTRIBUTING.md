# Contributing to Beubo
Thank you for wanting to help! I want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Developed with Github
Create and discuss changes via Github. Please open an issue if you would like to report a bug or suggest new features and improvements. If you would like to contribute code please open a pull request. See [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/uberswe/beubo/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for directions on how to report security vulnerabilities.

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/uberswe/beubo/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/uberswe/beubo/issues/new).

## Ensure your code is well formatted
I use [lint](https://github.com/golang/lint) to ensure code is formatted well.
