## Beubo

Simply run `go run cmd/beubo/main.go` to get started.

When running Beubo for the first time an installation page will open at the specified port. The 
page asks for various details needed to configure your site including database details. You will 
need to create a database on a MariaDB (currently the only tested solution) server and provide details
so that Beubo can connect to it.

Once the installation is complete it will no longer be available, delete the .env file to redo the installation process.
